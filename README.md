# InstagramAutomation
The goal of this repository is to create a script that fully automates an Instagram Page.

The 'createReel Script' will take a clip from youtube and:
  1. convert that video into the correct dimensions for an instagram reel
  2. transcribe the audio of the clip and overlay it on top of the video
  3. use chatGPT to caption the video with hashtags for instagram using the transcript
